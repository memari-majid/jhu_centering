# JHU Meditation
This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to understand the impact of a daily meditation practice called Centering on well-being and health behaviors, as well as the influence of religious/spiritual meaning on the outcomes of the practice. The study design involves randomly assigning participants to one of three conditions: passive control (waitlist), active placebo (centering practice using a neutral word), and experimental (centering practice using a religious/spiritual word). The study will last four weeks and participants will complete brief daily surveys to self-report their well-being and health behaviors. Follow-up assessments will be conducted one day, one week, and one month after the four-week practice period. Optional study activities include journal entries and data gathering through a smartphone-based remote sensor measurement app. The randomization will be performed through the Qualtrics online survey platform.
