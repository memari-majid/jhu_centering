# JHU Meditation
The study aims to examine the impact of a daily meditation practice called Centering on well-being and health behavior. The meditation practice involves focusing on a word for 20 minutes and the study will test whether using a religious/spiritual word enhances outcomes compared to a neutral word. The study is a randomized control trial with three conditions: passive control, active placebo, and experimental. Participants will engage in the meditation practice for four weeks and respond to daily surveys, with follow-up assessments one day, one week, and one month after the four-week period. The study also includes optional activities such as journal entries and smartphone sensor data collection. The journal entries will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods, and the smartphone sensor data will provide information on movement, sleep, and communication patterns. The study will compare results within and between participants to determine the impact of the meditation practice on well-being and health behavior.
